# OSRS_bots

A collection of RuneMate bots written in **Java** for **Old School RuneScape (OSRS)**.  
This repository is my personal playground for:

- Practicing **Java coding** and object-oriented design  
- Learning about **automation**, **game scripting**, and **bot safety**  
- Experimenting with RuneMate’s **LoopingBot framework**, API calls, and event handling  
- Building scripts that mimic human-like behaviors (randomness, anti-patterns, etc.)  

---

## ⚔️ Current Focus
- Woodcutting bots (priority on willows, banking, and returning to last location)  
- Future expansions: Fishing, Mining, Combat training, and more utility bots

## 🚀 Getting Started

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** These bots are for **educational purposes only**.  
> Automating gameplay in OSRS **violates Jagex’s Terms of Service** and may lead to bans.  
> Use at your own risk.
