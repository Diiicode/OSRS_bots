# OSRS_bots

A collection of RuneMate bots written in **Java** for **Old School RuneScape (OSRS)**.

This repo is my playground for:
- Practicing **Java/OOP** and clean architecture
- Learning **automation & game scripting** on RuneMate
- Experimenting with **LoopingBot**, queries, and event handling
- Mimicking human-like behavior (breaks, camera movement, small delays)

> ⚠️ **Educational purposes only.**  
> Botting violates Jagex’s Terms of Service and can lead to bans. Use at your own risk.
